Welcome back to Popular Movies! In this second and final stage, additional functionality has been built in to the app.

Youâ€™ll find more information in the movie details view:
 
The app allows users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
The app allows users to read reviews of a selected movie.
The app allows users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star). This is for a local movies collection that the app will maintain.
The latest version has the app user experience optimized for tablets.
